                <p>
                    <b>Overview:</b> Baker Beach has seen an alarming increase
                    of erosion due to intensified king tides and winter storms
                    over the past few years. As local residents, we are working
                    to mitigate this environmental damage to safeguard the
                    beach’s slope, shoreline, and surrounding properties.
                    Protecting this area is essential not only for maintaining
                    the landscape but also for preserving critical habitats for
                    wildlife. The trees along the shore, vital to the stability
                    of the slope, are home to eagles and bats whose ecosystems
                    are directly threatened by further erosion. Doing nothing
                    risks losing not only land and vegetation but also these
                    essential habitats—something that anyone who walks the beach
                    can see is worth protecting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because we have witnessed an alarming increase of erosion in
                    the last five years we engaged a geologist 2 years ago to
                    better understand the mechanisms involved with the erosion
                    and to see if we should be concerned. The conclusion was
                    that the erosion is due to two main forces are at play: 1)
                    The toe of the slope is being undercut at the base by wave
                    action, which will only get worse with climate change 2) the
                    heavy storms that we are experiencing in winter are over
                    saturating the ground and causing trees to destabilize. And
                    this will only get worse with climate change (see image at end of document.)

                    <strong>Purpose of Project:</strong> Stabilize the slope and
                    shoreline along Baker Beach. The stabilization methods are
                    nature-based ("Green Shoring"), including vegetation
                    enhancement and bioengineering, beach nourishment, and wave
                    deflection with non-uniform rock clusters to supplement the
                    natural rock clusters on the beach.

                    <strong>Does this project restrict beach access?</strong>
                    Absolutely not. No access will be affected, and the beach
                    will always be accessible.

                        Why not build a rock-wall to adapt to and prepare for
                        rising sea levels?
                    </strong>
                    The province is opposed to rock-walls for aesthetic and
                    environmental reasons. Instead, we are using a
                    government-approved, science-based approach called
                    Green-shoring. This method aims to “preserve or
                    restore physical processes such as the natural actions of
                    water and sediment movement that maintain healthy
                    shorelines. Maintain or enhance habitat function and
                    diversity along the shoreline by making shorelines more
                    secure against erosion and flooding. And prevent or
                    reduce pollutants entering the aquatic environment.” We have
                    worked with professional biologists and geo-tech engineers
                    to develop a green-shoring solution that puts equal focus on
                    mitigating slope erosion from above by rejuvenating it with
                    native plants, and shoreline protection from below with an
                    intermittent nature-based shallow berm  that mimics the naturally occurring substrate.

                    <strong>
                        How does Green-shoring imitate the natural shoreline?
                    </strong>
                    This approach uses several methods to recreate natural
                    processes. Beach nourishment, for example, mimics sediment
                    deposits that typically result from landslides, bringing
                    coarse sediment to the backshore, foreshore, and low-tide
                    areas. By placing sediment in a 'loaf' shape, the initial
                    setup looks like a natural landslip, allowing waves and
                    currents to naturally redistribute materials along the
                    shore.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The design prioritizes using native materials like clean
                    pebbles and coarse sediment that resemble what would
                    naturally appear after a landslide. Non-uniform clusters of
                    rocks are also strategically placed along the foreshore,
                    imitating the natural spread of boulders in coastal
                    landslips. These clusters help absorb wave energy and
                    contribute to shoreline stability.

                    </strong>
                    Our plan protects the eelgrass and the midshipmen spawning habitat. To achieve this, we engaged the expertise of professional biologists to map out their habitat and the times of year they are used for various species life cycles.

                    <strong>
                        What about vegetation that may grow along the shore?
                    </strong>
                    In the backshore and foreshore areas, we expect to encourage
                    the growth of salt-tolerant plants through bioengineering
                    techniques and careful planting. Over time, salt-tolerant
                    grasses, sedges, and low shrubs may naturally develop on
                    stable sediment deposits, even through stormy weather.
                    Native salt-tolerant species are being considered for
                    planting to help stabilize the sediment and make the
                    shoreline more resilient.
